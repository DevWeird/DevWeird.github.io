# First Post.

Hi, guys.

This is Weird Developer working in hydraulic business sector.
I am strongly interested in computer programming and embedded computing.
A Strong belief that the business trand is shifting from the traditional hydraulic to 
smart and computer aided one make me deep dive into computer programming.

Although DevWeird is a super super rookie in programming, I believe every mistake and a small step of my efforts
will make me the Mighty Dr. Strange of Hydraulic Engineer skilled with computer science.

Please let me know better way or your opinions.
Will be really appreciated.
